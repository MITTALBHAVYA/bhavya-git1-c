# My First Git Repository: Journey of Learning C Language

Welcome to my first Git repository! This project marks the beginning of my programming journey in 2021, where I started learning the C language during my first year.

## Repository Overview

This repository contains various projects, exercises, and assignments I worked on while learning C. It serves as a record of my progress and the concepts I mastered along the way.

## Repository Link

You can find the repository [here](https://github.com/MITTALBHAVYA/bhavya-git1-c).

## Contents

1. **Hello World Program**
   - The classic first program to print "Hello, World!" to the console.

2. **Basic Syntax and Data Types**
   - Examples demonstrating basic syntax, variables, data types, and input/output operations in C.

3. **Control Structures**
   - Programs illustrating the use of conditional statements (if-else) and loops (for, while, do-while).

4. **Functions**
   - Code snippets showing how to define and call functions, along with examples of recursion.

5. **Arrays and Strings**
   - Exercises on manipulating arrays and strings, including sorting algorithms and string functions.

6. **Pointers**
   - Projects and examples focused on understanding pointers, pointer arithmetic, and dynamic memory allocation.

7. **Structures and Unions**
   - Programs demonstrating the use of structures and unions to create complex data types.

8. **File Handling**
   - Examples of reading from and writing to files, along with basic file operations.

9. **Mini Projects**
   - Small projects that integrate multiple concepts learned, such as a simple calculator, a basic game, or a student management system.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Basic understanding of the C programming language

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MITTALBHAVYA/bhavya-git1-c.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd bhavya-git1-c
   ```

### Running the Programs

To compile and run any of the programs, use the following commands in your terminal:

1. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   gcc program_name.c -o program_name
   ```
2. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   ./program_name
   ```

## Learning Objectives

- Understand and apply the basic syntax and semantics of the C language.
- Gain proficiency in using control structures and functions.
- Learn to work with arrays, strings, and pointers.
- Develop skills in organizing code using structures and unions.
- Handle file operations for reading and writing data.
- Implement small projects to reinforce learning and integrate multiple concepts.
